        <h1>What is water pollution?</h1>
        <p>Water pollution happens when toxic substances enter water bodies such as lakes, rivers, oceans and so on, getting dissolved in them, lying suspended in the water or depositing on the bed. This degrades the quality of water.

            Not only does this spell disaster for aquatic ecosystems, the pollutants also seep through and reach the groundwater, which might end up in our households as contaminated water we use in our daily activities, including drinking.</p>

    <h1>How water is polluted and the effects of it?</h1>
    <p>Water pollution can be caused in a number of ways, one of the most polluting being city sewage and industrial waste discharge. Indirect sources of water pollution include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rain.

        Soils and groundwaters contain the residue of human agricultural practices and also improperly disposed of industrial wastes.</p>

    <h1>Types of water pollution</h1>
    <p>Pollutants can be of varying kinds: organic, inorganic, radioactive and so on.</p> 
    <h1>Point Source Pollution</h1>
    <p>When contamination originates from a single source, it is called point source pollution. Examples include wastewater (also called effluent) discharged legally or illegally by a manufacturer, oil refinery, or wastewater treatment facility, as well as contamination from leaking septic systems, chemical and oil spills, and illegal dumping. The EPA regulates point source pollution by establishing limits on what can be discharged by a facility directly into a body of water. While point source pollution originates from a specific place, it can affect miles of waterways and ocean.</p>   
    <h1>Non-Point Source Pollution</h1>
    <p>Nonpoint source pollution is contamination derived from diffuse sources. These may include agricultural or stormwater runoff or debris blown into waterways from land.</p>

    <h1>Whats Saving Marine Life all about?</h1>
    <p>Pollution is one of the biggest problems in the world but the most neglected one is water pollution which is harmful to marine life and reduces their life expectancy. Almost 100 million animals die from Water pollution every year this does not only affect Marine Life but 1 of our biggest source of food(Protein) as over 1 billion people rely on seafood as their primary source of animal protein. My organizations aim is to reduce water pollution by using enzymes(which are biodegradable and environmentally friendly) which will degrade plastics in the ocean almost completely.  There are quite a few chemicals but the is a recently discovered enzyme which was mistakenly discovered at a German Cemetary  which is a  highly efficient enzyme that degrades PET( which is a acronym for a very versatile and sophisticated plastic called polyethylene Terephthalate) which is called PHL7 which could make recycling faster by almost 90% and also does not contain nitrogen and phosphate which are the main chemicals that pose a threat to Marine life . There are other factors that contribute to water pollution such as nutrient pollution where the excess use of fertilizers ultimately flow to the ocean. High concentration of this becomes toxic to Wildlife and humans. This can be reduced by using the proper amount, at the right time of year and with the right method can significantly reduce how much fertilizer reaches the ocean. Creating awareness of this type of factor contributing to water pollution would be one of Saving Marine Lifeâ€™s priority This would create jobs for many unemployed citizens and make life for our Marine better(health wise).Saving Marine life(SML) would be funded through various donations and would be in partnership with many aquariums. </p>
